### 1.2.1: 
- Using imgur to host read-me images.

### 1.2.0
The focus of this release was on increasing the game difficulty, fixing bugs and *FINALLY* implementing a **ghost piece preview**.

- Fixed a bug that the fall rate of the game didn't changed when the game was restarted.
- Implemented the **ghost piece preview** of the blocks, showing where the piece will be placed.
- The fallrate of the pieces has been changed from `0.5` to `0.8` and the level of the game now changes every `5` cleared lines, instead of `10`. This Change was intented to make the game a little harder, maybe that could possible make the game a little frustrating at higher levels, but when the implementation of the `merge delay` comes, it will be much more confortable.
