## Features
Play a game similar to Tetris inside VSCode.
~~The current version is a Alpha version~~, Now with the first official release!

You can play a falling block game like, very similiar to TETRIS, with many of the same features from the official game.

## Known Issues

* Pieces dont rotate on the sidewalls by now.
* If the game restarts while hard dropping, depending on the piece, some fragments of the tiles is still on the board.
* Sometimes when you get a game over, the pieces might merge.
* The current rotation algorithm is not the best algorithm, which means the [SRS](https://tetris.wiki/Super_Rotation_System) algorithm by now is only half implemented.

### 1.0.1
